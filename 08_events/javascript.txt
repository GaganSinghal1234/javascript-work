//default js
javascript is a synchronous language
javascript is single threaded


//execution context
execute one line of code at a time 
console log -1
console log -2

each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing


blocking code: block the flow of program(read file sync)
                        vs 
non blocking code : does not block executon(read file async)

[call stack , memory heap] = javascript engine calls=> webapi((settimeout,setinterval,setevent,fetch())=>registercall back) connected => task queue in a cycle
